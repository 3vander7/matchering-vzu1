# Our Thoughts

### Why can't such online service be succeed nowadays?

- Very little potential audience. Let's explain: **all audio people** (100%) minus **audio novices who don't know about mastering** (40%) minus **pro audio guys who can make mastering by themselves** (20%) minus **guys who don't believe in automated mastering** (30%), the remaining 10% is **the group of people who open to novel things**, but this group is too small
- Mastering engineers think such services will replace them => no support from **pro audio guys** like [KVR community]

### It's just numbers!

We have bad news for you, if you think that good audio [mastering] can be done only with very expensive analog studio equipment. It's **a myth** that brings money to *a certain group of people*. The times of [vinyl] and [cassettes] are passed. All [audio] is digital now: it's all about [bytes] - [integers] and [floats]. All modern [audio] can be processed via [DSP techniques][DSP]. And [everything][DSPApps] can be done by [it][DSP]. Just use **good audio software and plug-ins** or learn [DSP] with *some suitable programming languages* to make **your own stuff**. 😉

### Why did original [Matchering] web service close?

- Too much marketing investments needed to convince people that **Matchering** works. And it works with more precision than handmade [mastering] *in most cases*
- Too much investments in hardware needed before going **paid**:
  - ~~Paid online service needs to keep all done masterings at user's personal area => **too many HDDs needed**~~
  - ~~Also it needs to be quickly accessible anywhere in the world => **too many VPSes from different suppliers needed**~~
  - ☝️ And we didn't know anything about [DevOps methodology] and [Cloud Computing Services] 😂
  - Also it needs **highly qualified support service** for clients => **salary payments needed**
  - Etc.

*This amount of money was unaffordable for three ordinary students from Russian Federation*.

### Why was it supposed to be successful? (As we thought)

Do you remember [Prisma]? **Matchering** is like **audio-Prisma** for sound options like [RMS], [FR], [peak amplitude] and [stereo width].

### Why are online [mastering] services without references useless?

Online [mastering] services without possibility to upload a **REFERENCE** is a [black box]. How can it know how **your track** should sound? There are so much different *genres* and *styles*, and all of them need their individual approach to processing. And there are so much different *soundings* in them. And without a **REFERENCE** it's imposible to get good results. *It's pure mathematics.*
