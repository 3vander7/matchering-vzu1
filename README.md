# Matchering 2.0

### Matching + Mastering = ❤️

[Matchering 2.0] is a novel ~~**Containerized Web Application**~~ *(coming soon!)* and **[Python Library]** for audio matching and [mastering].

It follows a *simple idea* - you take TWO audio files and feed them into **Matchering**: 
- **TARGET** (the track you want to master, you want it to sound like the reference)
- **REFERENCE** (another track, like some kind of "wet" popular song, you want your target to sound like it)

Our algorithm matches both of these tracks and provides you the mastered **TARGET** track with the same [RMS], [FR], [peak amplitude], [stereo width] as the **REFERENCE** track has.
