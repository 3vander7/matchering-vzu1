# Matchering by Wokashi RG (ex. SOUND.TOOLS)

We're glad to share source code of closed [Matchering] project by **Wokashi RG (ex. SOUND.TOOLS)** to you.

[Matchering] was a novel online [mastering] service with a *simple idea* - you should upload 2 tracks: 
- **TARGET** (the track which you want to master, yours or not yours, you want it sounds like the reference);
- **REFERENCE** (another track, yours or not yours, you want your target sounds like it);

The result of **Matchering** is the **TARGET** track with the same [RMS], [FR], [peak amplitude], [stereo width] as the **REFERENCE** track has.

This information was at our site:
> We developed the unique automatic flexible processing algorithm, which offers a novel online mastering experience, where you show us: how your track should sound by sending the **REFERENCE**.
>
> Matchering will make your track sounds like you want:
> - 1st step - To match characteristics of your **TARGET** and the **REFERENCE** tracks;
> - 2nd step - To master your **TARGET** track with the **REFERENCE** track's mastering settings.
>
> It opens a wide range of opportunities:
> - You can make your track instantly sounds like your favorite artist's;
> - You can make all the tracks of your new album to sound the same very quickly;
> - You can find new aspects of your sound in experiments;
> - You can do everything as you want, because of: **Your References, Your Rules**.

And now you can make your own **Matchering** at home. Let's begin!

# Installation Prerequisites

## OS

Microsoft Windows 64-bit (for setup with [sound limiting]), or any OS which [MATLAB] supports.

## Basic Software

- [MATLAB] (tested on 2016a and newer);
- [Signal Processing Toolbox] for MATLAB;
- [Curve Fitting Toolbox] for MATLAB.

With this setup you will get results without [sound limiting]. If you have some **brickwall limiter plug-in** in your [DAW], you may use it with these results.

*(Optional)* If you want automated [sound limiting], get this:
- *(Optional)* `mrswatson64.exe` from [MrsWatson];
- *(Optional)* Some brickwall limiter VST2x64 DLL - original **Matchering** used `Elephant.dll` from [Voxengo Elephant].

### Why didn't we make limiting in MATLAB?

Making own quality brickwall limiting algorithm is very huge subject. And we had no time for it.

# Usage

1. Get our [scripts];
2. Place them in some place like `C:\matchering`;
3. Edit `runscript.m`:
   - `pathWorkspace` is the path to your tracks, for e.g. `'C:\matchering\workspace\'`;
   - `fileTarget` is your **TARGET** track, for e.g. `'target.wav'` ([supported formats]);
   - `fileReference` is your **REFERENCE** track, for e.g. `'reference.wav'` ([supported formats]);
   - `pathTemp` is the path for internal temp files, for e.g. `'C:\matchering\temp\'`;
   - `pathBin` is the path with `mrswatson64.exe` and some brickwall limiter VST2x64 DLL, for e.g. `'C:\matchering\bin\'`, keep it blank if you setup without [sound limiting], like `''`;
   - *(Optional)* `fileBrickwallLimiter` is the name of brickwall limiter VST2x64 DLL, ignored if `pathBin` is blank;
   - *Note: leave `\` in the end of all path variables, also these folders must exist and MATLAB should have proper folder permissions*;
   - Other DSP variables keep as is;
4. Run `run.bat` or `runconsole.bat`;
5. After processing your result file(s) will be in `pathWorkspace` folder.

If you have [sound limiting] setup, you will get two WAV files: limited 24-bit and 16-bit.

Otherwise you will get only one WAV file: not limited 32-bit floating point for future limiting in DAW.

## Error Codes

Our `matchering.m` module returns an integer that indicates a process, a success or a specific error.

# Our Thoughts

### Why can't such online service be succeed nowadays?

- Very little potential audience. Let's explain: **all audio people** (100%) minus **audio novices who don't know about mastering** (40%) minus **pro audio guys who can make mastering by themselves** (20%) minus **guys who don't believe in automated mastering** (30%), the remaining 10% is **the group of people who open to novel things**, but this group is too small;
- Mastering engineers think such services will replace them => no support from **pro audio guys** like [KVR community].

### It's just numbers!

We have bad news for you, if you think that good audio [mastering] can be done only with very expensive analog studio equipment. It's **a myth** that brings money to *a certain group of people*. The times of [vinyl] and [cassettes] are passed. All [audio] is digital now: it's all about [bytes] - [integers] and [floats]. All modern [audio] can be processed via [DSP techniques][DSP]. And [everything][DSPApps] can be done by [it][DSP]. Just use **good audio software and plug-ins** or learn [DSP] with *some suitable programming languages* to make **your own stuff**. ðŸ˜‰

### Why did [Matchering] close?

- Too much marketing investments needed to convince people that **Matchering** works. And it works with more precision than handmade [mastering] *in most cases*;
- Too much investments in hardware needed before going **paid**:
  - Paid online service needs to keep all done masterings at user's personal area => **too many HDDs needed**;
  - Also it needs to be quickly accessible anywhere in the world => **too many VPSes from different suppliers needed**;
  - Also it needs **highly qualified support service** for clients => **salary payments needed**;
  - Etc.

*This amount of money was unaffordable for three ordinary students from Eastern Europe*.

### Why was it supposed to be successful? (As we thought)

Do you remember [Prisma]? **Matchering** is like **audio-Prisma** for sound options like [RMS], [FR], [peak amplitude] and [stereo width].

### Why are online [mastering] services without references useless?

Online [mastering] services without possibility to upload a **REFERENCE** is a [black box]. How can it know how **your track** should sound? There are so much different *genres* and *styles*, and all of them need their individual approach to processing. And there are so much different *soundings* in them. And without a **REFERENCE** it's imposible to get good results. *It's pure mathematics.*

### Potential rewrite on open source platform

We believe that some *some enthusiasts* can rewrite **Matchering** on [Python]'s [NumPy].
