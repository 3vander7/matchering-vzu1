# Matchering 2.0

### Matching + Mastering = ❤️

[Matchering 2.0] is a novel ~~**Containerized Web Application**~~ *(coming soon!)* and **[Python Library]** for audio matching and [mastering].

It follows a *simple idea* - you should take 2 tracks: 
- **TARGET** (the track you want to master, you want it to sound like the reference)
- **REFERENCE** (another track, like some kind of "wet" popular song, you want your target to sound like it)
